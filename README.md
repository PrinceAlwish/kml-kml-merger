Hey 
have you ever used Google Earth Pro to create features?
I have this code that allows you to upload your files to one single GeoJSON file
Feel free to move your spatial analysis with this tool

# How to use the Platform: https://princealwish.github.io/kml-kml-merger/ 
1. You can create your files in Google Earth Pro either as point, lines or polygon
2. After that you can go to the button choose files and add your files you would love to add
3. Then click the button add files
4. After that download as GeoJSON file
5. You can use the open source QGIS for data visualization and further editing
